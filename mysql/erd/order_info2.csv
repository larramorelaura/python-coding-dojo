1;"Beetles";"Beetles are the largest order of living things, with over 290,000 species known worldwide.
Beetles have two pairs of wings, but the outer pair is a hardened covering on the top of the body making a straight line down the back.
Beetles have chewing jaws.";"Beetles eat plants, other insects, carcasses, pollen, and dung.";"2022-12-17 18:02:13";"2022-12-17 18:07:26";1
2;"Butterflies and Moths";"Moths and butterflies are the second largest order of insects. They have two pairs of wings covered with small scales that rub off easily. 
They are the only insects with sucking mouth parts in the form of a coiled tube.";"Butterflies and moths eat liquids, sometimes flower nectar or sometimes liquids from rotting fruits, sap, dung, silk, cotton, or fur.";"2022-12-17 18:05:58";"2022-12-17 18:07:26";1
3;"Bees, Wasps, and Ants";"Bees, wasps, and ants are the third largest order of insects. They have two pairs of thin, clear, membraneous wings.
The femals have a well-developed egg-laying organ and/or stinger at the end of their abdomen. Ants have wings only at certain stages in life, and sometimes have stingers.
Most wasps are parasites. Their young hatch and develop inside the bodies of other insects or spiders. Bees and wasps are important pollinators.";"Adult bees and wasps eat nectar. Parasitic wasps as larvae feed on the host insect or spider. 
Most non parasitic wasps are predators and scavengers who feed on dead animals or hunt insects and spiders. Bees have a plant based diet in general. Ants eat plants, animals, and fungi.";"2022-12-17 18:13:05";"2022-12-17 18:13:05";1
4;"Flies, Mosquitos, and Gnats";"Flies, mosquitos, and gnats are the fourth largest order of insects. They have one pair of wings. All adult flies have sucking mouth parts";"Adult flies feed on organic decaying material. Things like decaying fruit, vegetables, meat, plant secretions, and feces are some of the materials flies like to feed on.";"2022-12-17 18:16:07";"2022-12-17 18:16:07";1
5;"Crickets, Grasshoppers, and Locusts";"Crickets, grasshoppers, and locusts have thin leathery forewings that cover larger hind wings. They are important food for birds and other insect eaters.";"Grasshoppers and locusts are herbivores and eat grass and plants. Crickets are omnivores who also eat larvae, aphids, other insects, and insect eggs";"2022-12-17 18:19:44";"2022-12-17 18:19:44";2
6;"Dragonflies and Damselflies";"Dragonflies and damselflies have two pairs of long, narrow, membranous wings that are roughly equal in size. They also have large eyes and narrow abdomens.";"Adults feed on other insects like gnats and mosquitos";"2022-12-17 18:21:28";"2022-12-17 18:21:28";2
7;"Aphids, Cicadas, and Leafhoppers";"Aphids, cicadas, and leafhoppers have two pairs of membranous wings that are head together in a tent-like position over their bodies at rest.";"Adult aphids and lefhoppers feed on plant sap. Cicadas suck fluids from woody shrubs and trees.";"2022-12-17 18:23:17";"2022-12-17 18:23:17";2
8;"Bugs, Backswimmers, and Water Striders";"Bugs, backswimmers, and water striders are identified by a triangle on the back just behind the head. This is formed by the way they fold their forewings. They also have two pairs of wings. The forewings are hardened and the hind wings are membranous.";"These types of insects prey on other types of aquatic insects and even some small fish and tadpoles.";"2022-12-17 18:25:37";"2022-12-17 18:25:37";2
